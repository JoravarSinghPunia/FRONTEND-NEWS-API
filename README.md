# **The Byte Board**

## **Links**

You can access the live version of this app [here](https://thebyteboard.netlify.app/).

This application makes use of the backend API created myself that you can find [here](https://github.com/JoravarSinghPunia/BACKEND-NEWS-API)

## **About**

The Byte Board is a service built for the purpose of reading, viewing, commenting, sorting and liking recent news articles. Modelled after real world services, such as Reddit, this application makes use of information provided from my [backend API](https://github.com/JoravarSinghPunia/BACKEND-NEWS-API). The project was created with [React](https://react.dev/) and is now live and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The development process was driven by a set of user stories, illustrated using wireframes based on mobile-first principles. A component tree was then used to define the structure of the site, with consideration to Reacts state, props and context, as well as API calls and queries. Each user story was completed with its own ticket, with **frequent code reviews from Senior Software Engineers.**

## **Softwares/Libraries**

NPM,
Vite, 
Axios, 
React with React Router
